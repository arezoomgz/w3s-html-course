        <h1>Computer</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A computer is a versatile and essential device in modern life, revolutionizing how we work, communicate, and entertain ourselves. At its core, a computer processes information using a combination of hardware components, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage drives, and input/output devices. These components work together to perform complex calculations, run software applications, and manage data efficiently.</p>
